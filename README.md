Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
"Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding...
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store"
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
